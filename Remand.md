## Project Name
Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

## Overview
This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game where the user can compete against the computer. The user inputs their choice, and the computer randomly selects an option, with the program determining the winner based on the rules.

## Features
- User inputs their choice (rock, paper, scissors)
- Computer randomly selects an option
- Determines the winner and displays the result
- Offers the option to play again

## Usage Instructions
1. Run the program.
2. Follow the prompt to enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors).
3. The program will display both your choice and the computer's choice, announcing the result.
4. It will ask if you want to play again; enter "yes" to continue or "no" to end the game.

## Code Structure
- `import random`: Imports the random module to generate the computer's choice.
- `while True`: Creates an infinite loop allowing the user to play multiple rounds.
- `input()`: Captures user input and converts it to lowercase.
- `random.choice()`: Randomly selects the computer's option.
- Conditional statements determine the winner.
- `play_again`: Asks the user if they want to continue playing.

## Future Improvements
- Add input validation to ensure the user enters a valid option.
- Implement game statistics, such as win and loss counts.
- Provide a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience.
